# Practical Data Analysis

This is a compilation of the coursework I completed for Practical Data Analysis (PHP2550) at Brown University.

# Description

Statistical programming, data management, exploratory data analysis, simulation and model building and checking. Modern regression techniques such as cross-validation, bootstrapping, splines and bias-variance tradeoff will be emphasized.

# Outline

### Problem Set 1

Data : Individuals involved in a clinical trial that measured their pain on seven different days over the course of several weeks together with local weather information for each person. 

Analysis : Linear regression, interpretation of output of multiple regressions (each representing changes in individual's pain scores over time), data wrangling, correlations, t-tests, two-sided t-tests, table building / recreation.

### Problem Set 2

Data : Individuals with different indicators of kidney disease. Glomerular filtration rate, GFR, was used as outcome. Predictors included, but not limited to, serum creatinine, urine protein, sex, race, age, etc.

Analysis : Non-linear transformations, interaction terms, diagnostic plots, model performance, exploration of overfitting in linear regression through simulation

### Problem Set 3

Data : (1) Kidney data from Problem Set 1 and (2) radon data in Minnesota with house and county level data.
Analysis : Multilevel models. (1) Construction and interpretation of multilevel model in which pain varies within patient according to time and temperature and between patients these relationships vary with patient-level factors. (2) Constuction and interpretation of a two level model for houses within counties with predictors that correspond to variables measured on houses and counties with the county level predictor uranium.

### Problem Set 4

Data : Usage of wells in Bangladesh, outcome was wether or not people switched wells given different predictors including the level of arsenic in their well, the distance to the nearest safe well, whether household members are active in community organizations, and the number of years of education of the head of household.

Analysis : Logistic Regression (testing and training sets, predictive plots, confusion matrix, ROC plots), Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K Nearest Neighbor Analysis

### Problem Set 5

Data : Kidney data from Problem Set 1 and a second kidney data set with additional predictors for each individual

Analysis : Bootsrapping, Forward and Backward regression, Cross Validation, Stepwise Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Model Performance

### Problem Set 6

Data : Same data as Problem Set 5

Analysis : Non-linear transformations to improve model performance from Problem Set 5, Polynomials, Step functions, Splines, and Generalized Additive Models

### Final Project

Data : Simulated data from my outside of class research work, simulations representative of the 2015 Scott County, Indiana HIV outbreak

Analysis : Variable selection methods (Cross Validation, Stepwise Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Elastic Net) and Principal Component Analysis
